# Oversized
A Minecraft Resource Pack that uses CTM to allow textures too big for a 1m block. All textures used in this pack are free and public domain (not by me).

## Try It
You can use this resource pack as-is in either Lab-1.1 or Lab-1.3 encoding, downsized to 256x. You can find them under _Assets_ in the [Releases](https://github.com/null511/MCRP-Textureless/releases) section.

## Editing
If you do not already have it, you will first want to download a copy of [PixelGraph](https://github.com/null511/PixelGraph/releases). Links to CLI and UI can be found under _Assets_. To avoid publishing repository resources, `~/src` is used as the root content directory.

## License
Textures not owned by me; each is licensed separately.
