# Oversized
A Minecraft Resource Pack that uses CTM to allow textures too big for a 1m block. It is primarily made with free and public domain textures, but most have been heavily modified to fit minecrafts style. Shaders used below are _Kappa_, _BSL_, and _SEUS PTGI-HRR_. For more screenshots, see [media](https://github.com/Null-MC/Oversized/tree/main/media).

**Requirements:**  
- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home).
- _Options_ > _Video_ > _Quality_:
  + **Connected Textures**: _Fast_ or _Fancy_.
  + **Better Grass**: _off_.

- A shader supporting _PBR materials_, ie:
  + LabPBR: such BSL, Complementary, Kappa, MollyVX, etc
  + LegacyPBR: "Old" format, such as Seus Renewed/PTGI
  + Enable POM (_paralax occlusion mapping)
  + Disable POM Self-Shadows

## Try It
You can use this resource pack as-is in either legacy PBR or LabPBR [1.3] encoding; both in 512x, 256x, 128x, & 64x resolution variants. You can find them under _Assets_ in the [Releases](https://github.com/Null-MC/Oversized/releases) section.

## Editing
If you do not already have it, you will first want to download a copy of [PixelGraph](https://github.com/null511/PixelGraph-Release/releases). Links to CLI and UI can be found under _Assets_. To avoid publishing repository resources, `~/src` is used as the root content directory.

## License
Textures not owned by me; each is licensed separately.
